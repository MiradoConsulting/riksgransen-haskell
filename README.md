# riksgransen-haskell

## Part 1 (for developers & non-developers)

The first part of the workshop will be using a web app, so you will only need a web browser to join in.  Even if you're not a developer by day, you will get your hands dirty with some Haskell.

## Part 2 (for developers)

The second part will be more developer-focussed and will require you to install some things.

Checklist of things to have:
### Compiler
`ghc` should be installed and in your $PATH

### Package manager
`cabal` should be installed and in your $PATH

### IDE
* Bring your own favourite text editor :)
* My preference on Ubuntu is Kate.
* vscode and emacs are pretty good too.
